This project is from the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav)

This is an etch-a-sketch like project that generates an area of n x n squares with rainbow pixels on mouseover. 

Might be fun to make a maze with the grid in the future.
